## Veza Overview
Veza is the data security platform built on the power of authorization. Our platform is purpose-built for multi-cloud
environments to help you use and share your data more safely. Veza makes it easy to dynamically visualize, understand
and control who can and should take what action on what data. We organize authorization metadata across identity
providers, data systems, cloud service providers, and applications â€” all to address the toughest data security
challenges of the multi-cloud era. To learn more, please visit us at veza.com.
